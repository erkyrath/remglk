RemGlk: remote-procedure-call implementation of the Glk IF API

RemGlk Library: version 0.2.7.

This is source code for an implementation of the Glk library which
supports structured input and output.

RemGlk does not provide a user interface. Instead, it wraps up the
application's output as a JSON data structure and sends it to stdout.
It then waits for input to arrive from stdin; the input data must also
be encoded as JSON.

RemGlk is therefore like CheapGlk, in that it works entirely through
input and output streams, and can easily be attached to a bot or web
service. However, unlike CheapGlk, RemGlk supports multiple Glk
windows and most Glk I/O features. Whatever it's attached to just has
to decode the structured output and display it appropriately.

* How to build/install

RemGlk uses the autoconf toolset, so building/installation should be as
easy as:

    autoreconf --force --install
    ./configure
    make install

or, on one line:

    autoreconf --force --install && ./configure && make install

On most systems, as a regular user, you'll end up with the include
files in /usr/local/include/remglk/*.h, and the library in
/usr/local/lib/remglk/libremglk.a.  If you're consuming this library
from another autoconf-using tool, you can magically find the paths
with:

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([remglk])
